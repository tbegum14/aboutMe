                <p>Hi, I'm Thasnima and I'm a career changer looking to join the tech world. 
                    In my previous career I was a dentist and worked for 8 years in lots of different places. 
                    I've dabbled in code for a few years and love the problem solving algorithms. 
                    Since I went on maternity leave I've picked up web development in my spare time and I've been hooked ever since. 
                    Take a look at my recent projects I've done as a self taught student!
                <br>
                <br>
                At school I always loved maths and problem solving but when it came to careers advice it was always the traditional vocations that able students were pushed towards. I'm a second generation immigrant and sometimes the pressure of having a stable profession to make the sacrifices of our parents and grandparents worthwhile can be confusing. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Alas, I've found the world of programming now and it's a <span id="hello"><strong>Hello, World!</strong></span> from me!
                </p>
            </div>
